# #Processing a large list of NetCDF files
# This uses a series of binary functions that are part of the [NetCDF Operator (NCO)](http://nco.sourceforge.net/) suite. They are not part of python, but they are required in this instance because of the memory issues encountered with large datasets. NCO programs are standalone programs that must be installed and run separately. They are documented here for completeness.
# 
# We are trying to calculate first the mean, then the standard deviation for every variable:
# Standard Deviation = sqrt( sum(xi   (count-1)  )

# Now that we have the average, we can calculate the differences from the mean using NCBO. This takes the first file, subtracts the second file, and writes to the third file. In our case, we are creating a series of files that represent the difference from the mean.
# <pre><code>
# FORM
# ncbo input_file1 input_file2 output_file

# SPECIFICS
# ncbo /augie/gluster/data/netCDF/pmel/cccma/cccma_week2871.nc /augie/gluster/data/netCDF/pmel/cccma/Outputs/cccma_average.nc /augie/gluster/data/netCDF/pmel/cccma/Diff/cccma_diff_week2871.nc
# </code></pre>
# 
# NCBO can only work on one file at a time (it doesn't accept a list of files), so I wrote a bash script that loops through and does an NCBO command for every file in the listed directory. It is not elegant, but it works.
# <pre><code>
# #!/bin/bash
# count=1001
# while [ $count -le 2874 ]
# do
#     infile="/augie/gluster/data/netCDF/pmel/cccma/cccma_week${count}.nc"
#     mean="/augie/gluster/data/netCDF/pmel/cccma/Outputs/cccma_average.nc"
#     outfile="/augie/gluster/data/netCDF/pmel/cccma/Diff/cccma_diff_week${count}.nc"
#     echo "Executing: ncbo $infile $mean $outfile"
#     ncbo $infile $mean $outfile
#     let count=count+1
# done
# </code></pre>
# NCEA and NCBO are smart enough to use and preserve the variable names in each NetCDF file, so the resulting file will have a processed cube of data for all the variables already. It even preserves the Z column (so only averaging through time, not space).
# 
# Now that we have a directory full of anomalies, we can use NCEA again to calculate the root mean square of the differences (i.e., the standard deviation).
# <pre><code>
# FORM
# ncea -y rmssdn input_files, outputfile
# -y rmssdn: calculates the root mean square of the differences.
